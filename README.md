# BookSorter
Program that demonstrates time complexity of various sorting algorithms. The user chooses a sort and a time is returned. Due to copyright issues I will withhold the book files I had in the same folder. In the class TestSorter you must replace "1984" with whatever book you switch to. Additionally, there is also functionality to return an ordered version of the text in a .txt file.
